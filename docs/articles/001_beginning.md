# 1 - The beginning
<h5 align="right"><i>Posted March, 6rd, 2023 - Never updated</i></h5>

For this first article, I will present you who am I, and a bit of my passion.

## Who am I ?

Everything started when I was around 8, one of my uncles, who was architect, show me a software called Sketchup.
It was the first time I discovered that technology can produce realistic content (and it was more than 15 years ago).

I quickly started to play with the software, and then I tried something called Blender (2.49 at the time). I also tried to develop some simple scripts.
So I started to learn the traditionnals HTML/CSS/JS, then, Java (for Android), C/C++, C# (with Unity 4) and Python.

During High School, I choose to learn Mathematics, Physics and Biology, then, Art/CGI during University.

I got a master graduation in 2022 from [Pole 3D](https://pole3d.com/en/homepage/), a french CGI school.
My gradutation movie is "Close Your Eyes", you can find the trailer here:

Now, I'm currently working as a pipeline developer for the VFX industry. My main tools are Python, Shotgrid, Tractor and Maya. You can find more information of my work experiences on [LinkedIn :fontawesome-brands-linkedin:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piloegao/).

## My passions

I'm mostly interrested by the developement of games, softwares, applications.
I like to try and experiment with new technologies to find new way of developing.

One of the part that I like the most is developing prototypes, watch users trying it and making conclusion about it.
I currently looking into Machine Learning, since I believe this is the future of computing.

## What's next ?

This blog will be used to share my knowledge, open discussions and show you what can be done using technology.
