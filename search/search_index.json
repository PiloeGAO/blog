It was the first time I discovered that technology can produce realistic content (and it was more than 15 years ago).</p> <p>I quickly started to play with the software, and then I tried something called Blender (2.49 at the time). I also tried to develop some simple scripts. So I started to learn the traditionnals HTML/CSS/JS, then, Java (for Android), C/C++, C# (with Unity 4) and Python.</p> <p>During High School, I choose to learn Mathematics, Physics and Biology, then, Art/CGI during University.</p> <p>I got a master graduation in 2022 from Pole 3D, a french CGI school. My gradutation movie is \"Close Your Eyes\", you can find the trailer here:</p> <p> <p>Ferme les Yeux | Trailer | 2022 from P\u00d4LE 3D on Vimeo.</p> </p> <p>Now, I'm currently working as a pipeline developer for the VFX industry. My main tools are Python, Shotgrid, Tractor and Maya.
